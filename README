LDblLinkedList
Simple Double Linked List implementation
By David Newell

Released under the FreeBSD licence.

This is a demonstration of a simple double linked list implementation in C++,
used in another project. This library provides all the functions required to
recurse through a list and add/remove nodes at any point in the list.

A small series of tests are available in ./test/

To build the library:
	$ cd src/
	$ make

Documentation is available via Doxygen; to build:
	$ doxygen ./doxycfg
This will place HTML documentation in ./doxygen/html/
